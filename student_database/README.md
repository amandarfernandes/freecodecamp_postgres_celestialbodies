# Learn SQL by Building a Student Database: 

For this project, you need to log in to PostgreSQL with psql to create your database. Do that by entering 
```
psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=postgres 
```
in the terminal. Make all the tests below pass to complete the project. Be sure to get creative, and have fun!

Don't forget to connect to your database after you create it ðŸ˜„

### Instructions
 
+ Create a **students** database and connect to it.
+ Create four tables: students, majors, courses, majors_courses.
+ The **students**.csv file has four fields, you will make a column for each of those as well as an ID column. 
  1. Add a column to your students table named **student_id**. Give it a type of **SERIAL** so it automatically increments and make it a **PRIMARY KEY**
  1. The first column in students.csv is **first_name**. Add a column to the students table with that name. Make it a type of **VARCHAR(50)** and give it the **NOT NULL** constraint.
  1. The next column in the data is **last_name**. Add it to the students table. Give it the same ***data type and max-length as first_name*** and make sure it has the **NOT NULL** constraint.
  1. The next column is for the major. Since you will have each major in another table this column will be a foreign key that references it. 
      Create a column in the students table named **major_id**, give it a data type of **INT** for now. You will come back and set the foreign key later.
  1. Create the last column, **gpa**. The data in the CSV shows that they are decimals with a length of 2 and 1 number is to the right of the decimal. So give it a data type of **NUMERIC(2,1)**.
+  Let's fill in the **majors** table next.
    1. Add a **major_id** column to it. Make it a type of SERIAL and the PRIMARY KEY for this table
    1. This table will only have one other column for the name of the major. Add a column to it named **major**. Make it a VARCHAR with a max-length of 50 and give it the NOT NULL constraint.
+ Now, set the **major_id** column from the **students** table as a foreign key that references the major_id column from the majors table.
+ Next, is the **courses** table.
  1. Add a **course_id** column to it. Give it a type of SERIAL and make it the primary key.
  2. Add a **course** column to the courses table that's a type of VARCHAR. The course names are a little longer, so give them a max-length of 100. Also, make sure it can't accept null values.
+ The **majors_courses** junction table will have two columns, each referencing the primary key from two related table. 
  1. First, add a major_id column to it. Just give it a type of INT for now.
  2. Set the major_id column you just created as a foreign key that references the major_id column from the majors table.
  3. Next, add a course_id column to the same table. Just give it a type of INT again for now.
  4. Set your new course_id column as a foreign key that references the other course_id column.
  5. There's one thing missing. This table doesn't have a primary key. The data from courses.csv will go in this table. A single major will be in it multiple times, and same with a course. So neither of them can be a primary key. But there will never be a row with the same two values as another row. So the two columns together, are unique. You can create a composite primary key that uses more than one column as a unique pair
